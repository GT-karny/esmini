= XSD transformation

The unambiguous transformation into XSD is an important part in the standardization process. While UML is a formal way to describe domain specific aspects, the XML Schema and the XML documents as its instances are the most recognized part of the data model. The XSD and the XML technology determine an approach how documents can be exchanged between scenario authors, simulation system providers and other interested parties.

Currently scripting is available in the Enterprise Architect Corporate Edition and the Enterprise Architect Version 14.1 is used.

== Preparing the model
